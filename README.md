# Word-guessing-game
A game where players connected to the server built by the stream socket take turns in guessing a random word chosen from dictionary.txt by choosing a letter.
Start by running Makefile. Set up the server by running the executable wordsrv. Connect to the server by inputting "nc -C hostname 58231", where -C is replaced by -c on mac and hostname is the name of machine.
